    Maps are a item in the video game Minecraft that by holding in<br> 
    a players hand automatically map the surround area. The image above<br>
    is an example of what holding a map looks like in game.<br>
    This map is at 1:4 scale which means that for every one square on<br>
    the map it represents 4 blocks in Minecraft. Each Minecraft<br>
    block represents 1 meter in real life.

                   This map shows an idealized example of what a map looks like and represents <br>
                   in Minecraft. If you hover over a feature you can see what block is being <br>
                   represented. This map is at 1:1 scale meaning every square on the map is <br>
                   one block in Minecraft. Instead of showing actual imagery, Minecraft maps <br>
                   show a classified raster. The raster isn't classified very well however<br> 
                   as multiple blocks that are similar colors or share a common type tend to<br> 
                   have the same color on the map. If you hover over either gray patch, for example,<br> 
                   it will say "Stone and Gravel" as both blocks are the same color on the map.<br> 
                   In reality the leftmost patch is stone and the rightmost gravel.

                                    This reference image allows us to use ground truthing to determine<br>
                                    what detail is lost in the map. This image is taken from what is <br>
                                    at the bottom of the map looking north. You may start to see how <br>
                                    Minecraft maps represent features like topology and water depth. <br>
                                    They show hills by adding darker and lighter shading on either <br>
                                    side. For water depth the darker the blue, the deeper the water. <br>
                                    For the function maps in Minecraft serve, this is all the detail <br>
                                    that is necessary, but what if you could could make a map of a real<br>
                                    area look like this?

                                This is an example of what a real place may look like if it <br>
                                where classified like a Minecraft map. You can see how it is far from <br>
                                perfect for many reasons. This was made using one of many Minecraft Maps<br>
                                created by Mattias Brennecke on his website called <a href=https://earth.motfe.net>Minecraft Earth Map</a>.<br>
                                The area on the map shown is around the city of Tillimook on the Oregon Coast.<br>
                                The satellite image was taken from Sentinel 2. The Minecraft Map I used<br>
                                is at 1:500 scale meaning that there are 500 meters in real life for every<br>
                                one square on the map.
